1. In this website I have shown some courses of AIUB department wise. Where, all the course teachers, prices, how many students have taken the course, when it was published, and how many students have given this course are shown.
2. After showing the details of all the courses, there is a premium access button, which will not allow the user to go to the checkout page without logging in.
After login, you will be taken to the checkout page. If the checkout page is reloaded, the user stays on the checkout page.
